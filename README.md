# Yaba GitHub Release CLI

[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/yaba-release-cli.png?downloads=true&stars=true)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yaba-release-cli)

**Yaba** is a simple CLI tool that helps you manage releases of your GitHub projects.

## Prerequisites

You need `npm` in order to run the project on your local environment.

## Installing / Updating / Uninstalling

To install CLI package globally:

```shell
npm i -g yaba-release-cli
```

To Update:

```shell
npm update -g yaba-release-cli
```

To uninstall:

```shell
npm uninstall -g yaba-release-cli
```

## Setup

### Create Personal Access Token

Go to [Personal Access Tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens) page on GitHub and generate new token to
enable `yaba` CLI to access your repos.

* Give your desired name to your personal access token with `Note` section.
* Choosing `repo` scope is enough to use `yaba` CLI tool.

Now, your personal access token is generated. Copy that token and define that one as an environment variable:

```shell
export GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN=generated_personal_access_token
```

You can define that env variable into `~/.bashrc`, `~/.bash_profile` or `~/.zshrc` file, choose which one is suitable
for you. After defining the env variable, open new terminal or simply run `source ~/.zshrc`(here again choose where you
defined your env variable).

If the repository owner is another GitHub account or organisation, you can define that like below instead of passing the
owner to the command in every run.

```shell
export GITHUB_REPO_OWNER=repository_owner
```

Always `-o` or `--owner` has precedence over authenticated user. Presendence is
like `-o > GITHUB_REPO_OWNER > authenticated-user`.

### Slack Integration

If you want to announce your release/changelog to the specific Slack channel, you have to define below environment
variable with the appropriate value.

```shell
export SLACK_HOOK_URL=your_slack_hook_url
```

If the above variable is set and the `-p` command given while running the command, an announcement will be post to the
given Slack channel. You can find detailed information in the [Command Line Usage](#command-line-usage) section.

e.g.
```shell
yaba -p
```

```

You can run `yaba` from a git directory or any other directories which is not a git repo.

If you are in a git repo and if you want to prepare the release for that repo, you don't need to specify the repo name
with the command. The command will automatically detect the current directory and if it is a git repository `yaba` will
use it as `repo` for the command.

By default, if you don't specify `-o`, `-t`, `-n` and `-b` the command will prepare default values for them with the
below pattern:

```text
-o: authenticated_user
-t: prod_global_YYYYMMDD.1
-n: Global release YYYY-MM-DD
-b: Commits between last release and master/main branch
```

> **:bulb:** If you want to bypass the prompt that is before creating the actual release,
> you can use `-i false` flag. This could be useful if you use `yaba` in your automation tools.
